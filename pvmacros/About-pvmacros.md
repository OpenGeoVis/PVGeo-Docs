<!--- TODO: we need more info here --->
We will from now on refer to macros as a set of standard codes that can be used regardless of data sets or scenes in ParaView. ParaView's sense of macro is not robust enough for us so that we will be referring to traditional macros in ParaView as 'scripts' from here on. 

*Scripts are used on specific sets of data whereas macros can be used on any set of data.* For details on scripts, please look [here](../Scripts/About-Scripts.md).

### Macros
Macros, all of the `pvmacros` module, are standard codes that can be used regardless of data sets or scenes in ParaView. These codes complete tedious or recurring tasks either in ParaView's GUI or ParaView's batch processing environment. We will use macros to complete everyday tasks like saving screenshots of isometric views of a data scene or tedious tasks like making many slices of a single data set along a line.
