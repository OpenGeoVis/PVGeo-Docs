UBC Mesh 3D models are defined using a 2-file format. The "mesh" file describes how the data is descritized. The "model" file lists the physical property values for all cells in a mesh. A model file is meaningless without an associated mesh file. Default file delimiter is a space character.

Currently 3D mesh files work. We are implementing 2D compatibility currently.
