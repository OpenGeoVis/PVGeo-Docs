### Scripts
Scripts are Python codes we will use for tasks like loading scenes and for applying several macros at once for a specific project. It is often helpful to set up a script for a project so that you can quickly run all the visualization processing at once each time you update your model files or create new versions of your data.

*Scripts are used on specific sets of data whereas macros can be used on any set of data.* For details on macros, please look [**here**](../pvmacros/about-pvmacros.md).

## How to Run Scripts
Use the Python Shell from 'View->Python Shell' (or 'Tools->Python Shell' depending on your ParaView version) in the ParaView GUI. Do not import scripts as macros in ParaView as they become static in the ParaView GUI and make managing/changing quite difficult. To use scripts in the batch processing environment, use the `pvpython` program delivered in ParaView. On my OS X operating system it is under the `Applications/ParaView/Contents/bin/pvpython`. More info on all of this to come! <!-- TODO -->

To simply run the scripts in this repo, edit the script files under the `scripts/` directory for your use, then run them in ParaView by selecting 'View->Python Shell' (or 'Tools->Python Shell' depending on your ParaView version) then click 'Run Script'. Navigate to the `scripts/` directory in this repo and select the script you desire to use.
