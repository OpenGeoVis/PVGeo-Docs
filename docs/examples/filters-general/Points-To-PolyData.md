## Python Example

Take a look at `PointsToPolyData`'s code docs [here](http://docs.pvgeo.org/en/latest/suites/General-Filters.html#PVGeo.filters_general.PointsToPolyData).

```py
import numpy as np
from PVGeo.filters_general import PointsToPolyData

# NumPy array of points for input
points = np.random.random((100,3))

vtkPoints = PointsToPolyData(points)
print(vtkPoints)
```
